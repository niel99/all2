java is robust?
doGet() and doPost() are used in plave of service() in httpservlet
form method="get" sends links thorough url
form method="post" sends links hidden
get method is faster than post method
action redirects us to the new page/java file as specified
if srvlet uses doget then use get in form else use dopost
for post method in index
getParameter is used to recieve the data from index
madnatory data entry use required in input
type=email for validation of email using html
request dispatcher- forward method will keep the previous credentials and destroy all other servlets
include method restores all the servlet datas
senRedirect(filename) is used to redirect to other pages
without taking the servlet objects with it
scheme=http/https/ftp
host=www.google.co.in
path=host/anything
oracledb pass= indranil
Servlet context class is to set some values to some
privillages
its values migrates even if we change the servlet
ServletConfig is used to transmit config of the server
HttpSession class
sendRedirect only sends to Get servlets
Use Database in Java:
1.Establish a connection(DriverManager.getConnection(),Class.ForName())
2.Create Statements(PreparedSttements class)
3.ExecuteQuery and ExecuteUpdate for executing SQL sttements
4.to get results we use ResultSent class
