java is architecture-neutral
-is portable
-is slow
-has serious vulnerability
-completely oop so codes for simple tasks are much bigger
Procedural programming in C
POP Importance not given to data only but as well as to
functions
data can move freely from function to function
in multi function programs there are use of global variables
whose value can be changed to cause the functions to not work
properly
less secure as no data encapsulation
objects can be exclusive of a single class by using keywords
i.e only a single object can be created from a single class
array is a datatype? not a primitive one
class is a derived data type
square root without sqrt?
class is an abstract data type as it hides the func it contains
a static method belongs to a class not object
when we use static on a method it will belon to 
only the class that is it can be called only through the
class and not by the object
java overflow when typecasted to byte
explicit typecasting
prime loop till sqrt of number ?
linear flow of control ofjava and languages that don't have linear
flow of control?
algos are pseudocode and algos are all following a linear
flow of control. every language needs algos thus they
follow linear flow of control
For input:
import java.util.Scanner
Scanner ob= new Scanner(System.in)
int a=ob.nextInt();(for string use Line instead Int likewise)
equals method is used for comparing two strings.
if(name1.equals(name2)//compares the two strings character by character
lexicographic ordering- ordering when uppercase characters come before
lowercase also long strings come before short strings like book comes before bookcase
for this we use compareTo
i.e s1.compareTo(s2)
find voting eligibility of a person in india
check whether user input strings are equal or not
calculator menu driven calculator to perform +,-,*,\,%
simultanous equaton of two variables without matrix

cyclic nature of range i.e as range of byte is 127 to -128 so when casted into an integer >127
it overflows causing the value to be stored within a different number i.e here
130= 2+128(in int)
130=2-128(in byte)
next() ends the string with a " " whereas nextLine() doesn't end with a " " rather needs
newline(enter) to end the string

never use infinite loops

wap(menu driven) to accept a number in decimal format
take inputs from the user
1 convert to binary
	a bitwise or(take another binary number)
	b bitwise not
2convert to octal
3 convert to hexa decimal

for(int i:arr){
System.out.println(i);
}
printing array when length is unknown
for(;) is known as for each and used for iterating through collections

parameterized constructor: constructor passed within constructor
to assign some value while creating an object
constructors like methoda support overloading

taylor series of cos(x)=1-x^2/2!+x^4/4!-x^6/6!
using recursion
try catch?
access denied by java compiler is illegalaccess exception
unchecked exception example= array out of bounds
exception causing block in try and the remedy when the exception is found is within catch 
while exception object is its argument
runtime exception should never be before arithmaticexception/oranyotherexception
finally block is used to end the try-catch ladder
throws is used to ignore an exception
throw is used to handle exceptions which can't be ignored
throw exception while converting string into into integer
